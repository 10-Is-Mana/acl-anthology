The ROCLING conferences are sponsored by The Association for Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing (ACLCLP) in Taiwan. The ACLCLP goal has been to conduct research in computational linguistics, to promote the utilization and development of computational linguistics, to encourage research in the field of Chinese computational linguistics both domestically and internationally, and to maintain contact with international groups who have similar goals and to cultivate academic exchange.

The annual ROCLING conferences offer a unique opportunity for academic and industrial individuals and institutions to present research results in Chinese computational linguistics, speech processing, and related areas. The first conference was held in Nantou, Taiwan in 1988. It has since been held annually at various locations in Taiwan, except in 2002 when International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING) was held in Taipei.

ACLCLP also founded International Journal of the Association for Computational Linguistics and Chinese Language Processing (IJCLCLP) in August 1996. Initially, it was published twice a year. In order to promote research and technical advancement and play a more active role in this area, this journal publishes four issues per year from 2005. This journal covers all aspects related to computational linguistics and Chinese speech and language processing.
