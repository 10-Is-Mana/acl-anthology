      <p>General information on ACL Anthology assignments for event
	(proceedings) chairs: (<i>Updated as of 18 Jul 2014</i>)</p>

      <p>Currently, we assign each paper in the ACL Anthology a unique
	8-character identifier, so that we can easily locate papers and
	reference them.  The identifier is assigned by the current ACL
	Anthology Editor and is in the form of a letter, two digit year and a
	4 digit paper ID (e.g., W11-3801).  For large or prominent events
	related to ACL or its sister organizations that recur on a yearly
	basis, we use a separate lettered prefix, where all 4 digits of the
	paper ID can be used (usually accommodating separate volumes in the
	event, each capable of referencing up to 999 papers).</p>

      <p>For all other smaller events, we use the 'W' prefix.  These events
	accommodate up to 99 papers.  If there are multiple volumes for a such
	smaller events, they are assigned as two separate volumes (e.g.,
	shared tasks, student papers).</p>

      <p>More details:</p>

      <ol>
	<li><p>URLs for the Anthology (for START as well as the Anthology XML) look like:</p>
	  
	  <pre>http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W11-38xx</pre>
	  
	  <p>and not</p>
	  
	  <pre>http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W11/W11-38xx.pdf</pre>
	  
	  <p>(note, no .pdf and no intermediate path)</p>
	  
	  <p>where xx is the paper ID.  00 is used for the frontmatter, 01 for the
	    first paper, etc., and any author index is listed as the final paper.
	    In START you may see (and need to provide) this coded using C-like
	    format strings:</p>
	  
	  <pre>http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W11-38%02d</pre>
	</li>

	<li> The data in the ACL Anthology is (almost) completely
	  derived from the XML form of the paper and volume metadata
	  that is used to generate it.  If you can create this XML
	  representation for your event, it will be sufficient
	  information for us to generate the Anthology representation
	  (Web pages) for your event.  For events using START version
	  2 (via softconf.com), which is the default publication /
	  event manager software for ACL, this will be easy, as we
	  have transformation scripts to ingest directly from
	  the <code>proceedings.tgz</code> file that can be one-click
	  generated from START.  For other events, you will need to
	  provide this data on your own.  These metadata files are
	  publicly visible (but not linked) from the current
	  Anthology.  An example can be found at:<br/>

	  <pre><A HREF="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P15/P15.xml">http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P15/P15.xml</A></pre> (metadata for ACL 2015)

	  </li>

	<li> For copyright transfers, you can use the default forms at:
	  
	  <pre>http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~antho/acl-copyright-form-rev2011.pdf
http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/~antho/acl-copyright-form-rev2011.doc</pre>
	  
	  <p>Ask authors to sign the form, scan a B/W copy at 150 to 200 DPI for
	    you as a .pdf (or .jpg or .png if otherwise not possible).  Name the
	    forms using the ACL Anthology identifiers, and send me a separate .zip
	    or .tgz archive as you would for the proceedings of your event (e.g.,
	    a file in the archive might be copyright-transfers/P11-1001.
	    pdf).</p>
	  
	  <p>Note that if you are using the START system (softconf.com), there is a
	    digital form of this copyright transfer form, so you may not have to
	    ask the authors to print, sign and submit to you.  You may be able to
	    simply download the .zip or .tgz version of the archived forms and
	    submit them to me.  Please note this when submitting.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li> If you need to assign ISBN numbers, please provide the exact titles
	  of each volume to be assigned an ISBN and forward this information to
	  Priscilla Rasmussen, ACL Business Manager.</li>
	
	<li> <p>If there are supplemental attachments, software or datasets, also
	    please let me know about them when they are finalized so that we can
	    have them published in the Anthology in a timely manner.  You'll need
	    to provide a zipfile or other filetype (of a three letter extension
	    only) of each supplement, where the files are named by
	    their paper's Anthology ID (e.g., W11-1001.Dataset.zip)</p>
	  
	  <p>Current types supported by the Anthology are:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
	    <li>Attachment (this is for generic attachments; best to be specific
	      and avoid using this when possible)</li><br/>
	    <li>Dataset</li>
	    <li>Note</li>
	    <li>Poster</li>
	    <li>Presentation</li>
	    <li>Software</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>Videos are also accepted but only as valid hyperlinks.</p>
	  
	  <p>Any attachment is limited to 30 MB or a valid hyperlink (which should
	    be maintained in perpetuity, but reasonably maintained for at least 5
	    years).  Hyperlinks may lead either to the actual attachment or to a
	    valid containing &quot;home page&quot; for the resource.</p>
	  
	  <p>We prefer actual attachments over hyperlinks as we can serve them from
	    the Anthology directly, but understand that some materials cannot fit
	    within this size.  Attachments do not need to be author-anonymized
	    (although during the review process, program chairs may ask for this
	    -- authors should try to include provenance information with their
	    attachments).</p>
	  
	<li> <p>If you get requests from authors needing to post
	    errata or revised versions of the papers, or supplemental
	    attachments after the publication of the proceedings,
	    please ask them to submit revisions to the current ACL
	    Anthology editor directly (see <%= link_to "Corrections",
	    controller: "static_pages", action: "corrections" %>).</p>
	  
	  <p> If you wish to incorporate edits from your pipeline, we will also
	    accept revisions
	    from proceedings chairs of workshops (to replace the original version,
	    or to create a new version) if the ACL footer (i.e. "Proceedings of
	    ..." on header page) appears in the PDF with the correct page numbers,
	    only before the publication date.  After the publication date, the
	    full volume cannot be replaced or revised.</p></li>
	  
	<li> By default, the publication of papers associated with a
	  current event in the Anthology will be on the first day of the
	  event (inclusive of workshops or tutorials).  If you prefer to
	  have it published on a different date, please inform us.</li>
	
	<li> Please list the ACL SIGs endorsing or sponsoring each event, and
	  for each event, where not completely clear, give a short, acronym form
	  of the event name, for indexing (e.g., "ACL", "NAACL", "SocialNLP").
	  Acronym forms should be recognizable and consistent through
	  consecutive (multi-)annual events.  Please check the beta Anthology
	  (http://aclanthology.info/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=#
	  , see venue facet) to check whether the venue acronym has been used
	  before).  Please provide this information.</li>
	
        <li>For ingestion from events managed by Easy Chair, Nils
	  Blomqvist has created
	  a <A HREF="https://github.com/nblomqvist/easy2acl"><code>easy2acl</code></A>
	  script, which should make the transformation to the
	  aclpub format easier.
        </li>

	<li>Q: What data from START (softconf.com) does the Anthology
	  ingestion process actually use?<br/>  A: The Anthology
	  software uses a transformation script to revise the
	  distributed <code>.bib</code> files into the appropriate XML
	  metadata used by the Anthology.  We typically run this on
	  the full volume <code>.bib</code> file, provided at
	  the <code>cdrom/</code> directory that is adistributed by
	  START.  We primarily use three sources of information that
	  is just renamed from those sources:
	  <ul>
  	    <li>the bib files under cdrom/bib</li>
	    <li>the pdf files under cdrom/pdf</li>
	    <li>the whole volume bib/pdf files under cdrom</li>
          </ul>
	<p>We also use the cdrom/attachments when they are provided (optional)</p></li>
	</li>
