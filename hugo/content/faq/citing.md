Title: How do I cite publications in the ACL Anthology?
weight: 1
---

Please do not publish the actual links to this site in print publications, as
these may change over time. Instead, use Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for
newer materials (post-2015), or the persistent URL for older materials
(pre-2015) e.g., https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E91-1001 (thanks to Dragomir
Radev and Haejoong Lee for the latter). Both the DOIs and the persistent URLs
embed the 8-character ACL Anthology Identifier.
